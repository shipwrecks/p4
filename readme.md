#P4 - Task Manager

##Live URL

http://p4.nearsightedninja.me

##Description

This is a simple task manager site that includes:

    User authentication so different users can have their own task lists.
    A page to display all incomplete tasks.
    A page to display all completed tasks.
    A page to add new tasks.
    A page to edit the content of existing tasks.
    A page to delete a task.
    A page to add website suggestions.

My tables are users table, tasks table, and a suggestions table.
Users can only see their own tasks, but they can see all submitted suggestions.

##Demo

I demo'd my project during the 12/13/14 section. 

##Details for teaching team

I've created two accounts with tasks already in it.  (email = dwa15@dwa15.dwa15; password = dwa15dwa15) 
(email = asdf@asdf.asdf, password = asdfasdf)  I have not added anything to the suggestion box at this time 
to demonstrate that the page has a message if no suggestions have been submitted.
