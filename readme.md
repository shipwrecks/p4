##Live URL

http://p4.nearsightedninja.me

##Description

This is a simple task manager site that includes:

    User authentication so different users can have their own task lists.
    A page to display all incomplete tasks.
    A page to display all completed tasks.
    A page to add new tasks.
    A page to edit the content of existing tasks.
    A page to delete a task.

My tables are users table, tasks table, and a suggestions table.
Users can only see their own tasks, but they can see all submitted suggestions.

##Demo

I demo'd my project during the 12/13/14 section.
